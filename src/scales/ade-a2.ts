/**
 * @experimental NOT YET FUNCTIONAL. See #159 for status.
 *
 * Reverse-engineered scaffolding for ADE A2-family scales:
 *   BA1400, BA1401, BE1511, BE1512, BA1501, BA1502
 *
 * The {@link AdeA2Adapter} class is intentionally NOT registered in
 * `src/scales/index.ts` and an automated test guards that. Its `matches()`
 * always returns `false`, every characteristic UUID is the empty-string
 * sentinel `UUID_TBD`, and `onConnected()` is a no-op, so the class cannot
 * write anything to a real device, even if a future contributor manually
 * adds it to the registry without finishing the protocol decode.
 *
 * The reverse-engineered protocol pieces that ARE verified live as exported
 * pure helpers ({@link buildAdeA2TimeSyncCommand},
 * {@link buildAdeA2ChallengeResponse}) so they can be tested independently
 * and reused once the missing pieces are filled in.
 *
 * ## What's known (from fitvigo 1.2.2 APK reverse engineering)
 *
 * - Service UUID: **0x7802** (confirmed via
 *   `corelib::VScaleA2CollectionProtocol::serviceId()` returning `0x7802`).
 * - Single-char measurement dispatch (`onCharacteristicChanged` matches
 *   only one char index from `config->[0x18]`); no separate body-composition
 *   push frame. Body composition is computed on-phone from weight + impedance
 *   + user profile (`addBodyAnalysysTo(IScaleRecord, float, float)`), so the
 *   BLE frame carries weight + impedance only.
 * - Pairing handshake inherits `VBaseA2PairingProtocol` (same as Trisa):
 *     - Scale → host: `0xA0` (password) on the upload channel
 *     - Scale → host: `0xA1` (challenge)
 *     - Host → scale: `[0xA1, XOR(challenge, password)]` on the write channel
 * - A `writeTimeOffset()` step in `VScalesA2PairingProtocol` issues a
 *   time-sync command before measurement is unlocked. The frame layout
 *   matches Trisa: `[0x02, <4-byte LE seconds-since-2010>]`.
 *
 * ## What's NOT known yet
 *
 * - **BLE local name prefix.** Trisa uses `01257B` / `11257B`. A2 family
 *   advertises differently. Possibly a different vendor prefix, or fitvigo
 *   may rely on the service UUID alone.
 * - **Characteristic UUIDs inside service `0x7802`.** Native code resolves
 *   chars through a runtime config struct; an HCI capture is needed to pin
 *   them down.
 * - **Weight + impedance frame layout.** `saveMeasurements(vector, bool)`
 *   is ~2.1 KB of optimized native code with multiple flag-driven branches.
 *
 * ## How to finish this adapter
 *
 * 1. Run `DEBUG=true npm run scan` against the target scale; capture the
 *    BLE name + advertised service UUIDs.
 * 2. Capture an HCI snoop log of a complete fitvigo weigh-in (instructions
 *    in #138 thread).
 * 3. Replace each `UUID_TBD` constant with the observed UUID.
 * 4. Update `matches()` with the observed name prefix.
 * 5. Implement `parseMeasurement()` against frames from the capture.
 * 6. Wire `onConnected()` to call {@link buildAdeA2TimeSyncCommand} and
 *    forward `buildAdeA2ChallengeResponse` from the upload-channel handler.
 * 7. Add fixture tests, register in `src/scales/index.ts`, drop the
 *    `@experimental` flag.
